I received my master's degree in Electrical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and my bachelor's at Sun Yat-sen University, China. My master's thesis focuses on medical image processing and deep learning, especially image segmentation. During the internship practice, I also gained valuable experience in EEG processing and network architecture search. I joined MatTech Lab as a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Benedetta Franceschiello, and worked as an affiliated PhD student with Prof. Jessica Bastiaansen at QIS Lab, University of Bern. My research is centered on developing an innovative anatomical and functional MR-Eye protocol capable of mitigating distortions caused by eye movements and addressing the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. This protocol will enable the acquisition of high-resolution (in micrometers) images with robustness to eye motion at the millisecond level. My objective is to implement algorithms that enhance image quality and facilitate the disentanglement of sub-millimeter eye structures on both clinical (3T) and research (7T) MRI scanners.

Information about FID signal FID signals https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/free-induction-decay#:~:text=Free%20Induction%20Decay%20(FID)%20refers,its%20original%20alignment%20with%20B0. When an RF pulse is turned off, protons begin to lose phase coherence, resulting in an exponential decrease of the signal intensity to zero. This signal decay is called free induction decay (FID) (Currie et al., 2013). FID signal has a resonant frequency, which takes the form of a sine wave, which is at its highest immediately after the RF pulse is switched off and decreases as relaxation occurs. An RF pulse at any flip angle can create an FID because some protons in longitudinal magnetization are tipped into transverse magnetization. How to extract the FID from raw data 1. Understand the Acquisition Setup FID signals are collected before the imaging gradients are fully applied. The FID contains information about the global magnetization state of the tissue but has no spatial encoding yet. In radial stack-of-star sequences, the FID signal corresponds to data at or near the k-space center, typically sampled immediately after the RF pulse. why The FID signal is generated immediately after the RF excitation pulse, as soon as the spins start precessing. The gradients needed for spatial encoding are typically applied after the FID starts . This delay is necessary because: The RF pulse and gradients require separate timing to avoid interference. Applying gradients during the RF pulse or immediately afterward can distort the FID and reduce signal quality. The initial part of the signal , acquired before the gradients are active, represents the \"pure\" FID\u2014this is the part you extract for motion detection or other analyses. 2. Identify the FID Portion in Raw Data The FID is typically acquired as the initial part of each readout, before gradients start encoding spatial information. 3. Extract k-Space Center The FID signal corresponds to the low spatial frequency (k-space center) information. You can identify this by: Temporal Location: Extract data samples immediately after the RF pulse and before the imaging gradients are active. 4. FID in the Context of a Stack-of-Star Sequence In radial sequences like stack-of-stars, k-space is sampled using radial trajectories starting at the center. At the start of each radial spoke, the k-space center is sampled, and this corresponds to the initial FID signal . Because the gradients are weak or inactive near the k-space center, the early signal is dominated by the FID, with minimal spatial encoding effects. 5. How Motion Affects the FID Motion impacts the FID signal in the following ways: a. Phase Changes Due to Motion Motion alters the relative positions of spins in the magnetic field, which changes their precession phase. These phase changes are global (affecting the whole signal) and become apparent in the FID because the FID is the earliest signal captured after excitation. For example, a small head movement during the acquisition will introduce phase shifts, which can be detected in the FID signal. b. Amplitude Modulation Motion can cause signal dephasing, where spins lose coherence due to changing positions or velocities. This results in a reduced FID amplitude. Additionally, periodic motions (e.g., respiratory or cardiac motion) may modulate the FID signal amplitude in a predictable way. c. Frequency Shifts If the motion involves velocity (e.g., blood flow or respiratory motion), it can introduce frequency shifts due to the Doppler effect. These shifts can also be detected in the FID.

Golden\u2010angle ordering with an angular increment of 111.246\u00b025 is used for continuous data acquisition.","title":"Information about stack-of-star sequence"},{"location":"nav/papers/bulk/","text":"","title":"Bulk"},{"location":"nav/papers/fetal/","text":"","title":"Fetal"},{"location":"nav/setup/colors/","text":"January 17, 2023 Changing the colors Color scheme Default: light theme: theme_style: light light dark Primary color Default: black theme: colors: primary: black black blue green yellow orange purple red white Text color Default: black theme: colors: text: black black blue green yellow orange purple red white Title color Default: black theme: colors: title: black black blue green yellow orange purple red white Background color Default: white theme: colors: background: white black blue green yellow orange purple red white","title":"Colors"},{"location":"nav/setup/colors/#changing-the-colors","text":"","title":"Changing the colors"},{"location":"nav/setup/colors/#color-scheme","text":"Default: light theme: theme_style: light light dark","title":"Color scheme"},{"location":"nav/setup/colors/#primary-color","text":"Default: black theme: colors: primary: black black blue green yellow orange purple red white","title":"Primary color"},{"location":"nav/setup/colors/#text-color","text":"Default: black theme: colors: text: black black blue green yellow orange purple red white","title":"Text color"},{"location":"nav/setup/colors/#title-color","text":"Default: black theme: colors: title: black black blue green yellow orange purple red white","title":"Title color"},{"location":"nav/setup/colors/#background-color","text":"Default: white theme: colors: background: white black blue green yellow orange purple red white","title":"Background color"},{"location":"nav/setup/components/","text":"January 21, 2023 Enable and Disable Components Site Name Default: true theme: components: site_name: true true false Title Default: true theme: components: title: true true false Menu Default: true theme: components: menu: true true false Preview Default: true theme: components: preview: true true false Footer Default: true theme: components: footer: true true false","title":"Components"},{"location":"nav/setup/components/#enable-and-disable-components","text":"","title":"Enable and Disable Components"},{"location":"nav/setup/components/#site-name","text":"Default: true theme: components: site_name: true true false","title":"Site Name"},{"location":"nav/setup/components/#title","text":"Default: true theme: components: title: true true false","title":"Title"},{"location":"nav/setup/components/#menu","text":"Default: true theme: components: menu: true true false","title":"Menu"},{"location":"nav/setup/components/#preview","text":"Default: true theme: components: preview: true true false","title":"Preview"},{"location":"nav/setup/components/#footer","text":"Default: true theme: components: footer: true true false","title":"Footer"},{"location":"nav/setup/favicon/","text":"January 17, 2023 Changing the favicon theme: favicon: assets/favicon.ico","title":"Favicon"},{"location":"nav/setup/favicon/#changing-the-favicon","text":"theme: favicon: assets/favicon.ico","title":"Changing the favicon"},{"location":"nav/setup/fonts/","text":"January 17, 2023 Changing the fonts Site name style Default: normal theme: site_name_style: normal normal bold italic scratched underline overline Title style Default: bold theme: title_style: bold normal bold italic scratched underline overline","title":"Fonts"},{"location":"nav/setup/fonts/#changing-the-fonts","text":"","title":"Changing the fonts"},{"location":"nav/setup/fonts/#site-name-style","text":"Default: normal theme: site_name_style: normal normal bold italic scratched underline overline","title":"Site name style"},{"location":"nav/setup/fonts/#title-style","text":"Default: bold theme: title_style: bold normal bold italic scratched underline overline","title":"Title style"},{"location":"nav/setup/logo/","text":"January 17, 2023 Changing the logo theme: logo: assets/logo.png","title":"Logo"},{"location":"nav/setup/logo/#changing-the-logo","text":"theme: logo: assets/logo.png","title":"Changing the logo"}]}
