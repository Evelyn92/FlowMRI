Ciao, Iâ€™m Yiwei Jia.  I received my master's degree in Electrical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and my bachelor's at Sun Yat-sen University, China. My master's thesis focuses on medical image processing and deep learning, especially image segmentation. During the internship practice, I also gained valuable experience in EEG processing and network architecture search.

I joined MatTech Lab as a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Benedetta Franceschiello, and worked as an affiliated PhD student with Prof. Jessica Bastiaansen at QIS Lab, University of Bern. 

My research is centered on developing an innovative anatomical and functional MR-Eye protocol capable of mitigating distortions caused by eye movements and addressing the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. This protocol will enable the acquisition of high-resolution (in micrometers) images with robustness to eye motion at the millisecond level. My objective is to implement algorithms that enhance image quality and facilitate the disentanglement of sub-millimeter eye structures on both clinical (3T) and research (7T) MRI scanners.
