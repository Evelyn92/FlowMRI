 🐾  Usage of eye atlases

## 💫My question
I want to use that for segment specific area for calculating SNR, CNR... Now I have template.nii.gz: atlas of the eye images (per sex), and max_prob_map.npy and max_prob_map.nii.gz: maximum probability maps (per sex), I also have my 3d image in pkl format. How can I do the registration and mask out the region I need?

## 💥Answer from ChatGPT

To use the **eye atlas** and **probability maps** for segmenting specific regions and calculating metrics like **SNR** and **CNR**, you'll need to go through several steps, which include image registration, applying masks, and performing the desired calculations. Here’s a general outline of the process:

### 1. **Prepare the Data**
   - You have the following:
       - **template.nii.gz**: A template atlas (likely a brain or eye atlas).
       - **max_prob_map.npy or max_prob_map.nii.gz**: Maximum probability maps for each sex.
       - **3D image in PKL format**: This is your raw 3D image data.
   
   - **Objective**: Register the **3D image** to the **template atlas**, use the **probability maps** to mask the regions of interest, and calculate metrics like **SNR** (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and **CNR** (Contrast-to-Noise Ratio) on those regions.

### 2. **Convert PKL to NIfTI (if needed)**
If your 3D image is stored in a **PKL file** (Pickle format), you'll first need to load the PKL file and convert it to a **NIfTI file** (.nii.gz), which is a more common format for medical imaging tasks.

Here's how you can do that in Python:

```python
import pickle
import nibabel as nib
import numpy as np

# Load your PKL file
with open('your_image.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    image_data = pickle.load(f)

# Convert the image data to a NIfTI format
image_nifti = nib.Nifti1Image(image_data, affine=np.eye(4))

# Save the NIfTI file
nib.save(image_nifti, 'your_image.nii.gz')
```

This will give you a **NIfTI file** of your image.

---

### 3. **Register the 3D Image to the Template Atlas**
To align your 3D image with the **template.nii.gz** (the atlas), you can use **image registration**. A popular tool for this is **FSL** (`flirt` or `fnirt`) or **ANTs** (Advanced Normalization Tools). 

Here’s how you can use FSL to register the images:

#### FSL Registration Example:

```bash
# Using FSL's flirt for linear registration
flirt -in your_image.nii.gz -ref template.nii.gz -out registered_image.nii.gz -omat transform.mat
```

This command will perform a **linear registration** of your **image** to the **template** and save the output as **registered_image.nii.gz** along with the transformation matrix **transform.mat**.

If you need non-linear registration (e.g., to handle more complex deformations), you can use **fnirt**:

```bash
# Using FSL's fnirt for non-linear registration
fnirt --in=your_image.nii.gz --ref=template.nii.gz --out=registered_image_nl.nii.gz --aff=transform.mat
```

After registration, your **3D image** will be aligned to the **template atlas**.

### 4. **Masking the Desired Region Using Probability Maps**
You can use the **maximum probability map** (`max_prob_map.nii.gz`) to identify and mask specific regions of interest in the registered image. The probability map indicates the likelihood of a certain structure or region in the atlas.

To extract and mask specific regions based on the probability map:

#### Using `nibabel` and `numpy`:
```python
import nibabel as nib
import numpy as np

# Load the registered 3D image and the probability map
registered_image = nib.load('registered_image.nii.gz')
prob_map = nib.load('max_prob_map.nii.gz')

# Get the image data (as numpy arrays)
image_data = registered_image.get_fdata()
prob_map_data = prob_map.get_fdata()

# Define a threshold (e.g., 50% probability) for masking
threshold = 0.5
mask = prob_map_data > threshold

# Apply the mask to the registered image
masked_image = image_data * mask

# Save the masked image
masked_image_nifti = nib.Nifti1Image(masked_image, registered_image.affine)
nib.save(masked_image_nifti, 'masked_image.nii.gz')
```

This will create a **masked image** (`masked_image.nii.gz`) where the regions of interest, as identified by the probability map, are kept and everything else is set to zero.

---

### 5. **Compute SNR and CNR**
After masking the desired regions, you can now compute **SNR** and **CNR** using the masked regions. The formulas for these metrics are:

- **SNR**: \( \text{SNR} = \frac{\mu_{\text{signal}}}{\sigma_{\text{noise}}} \)
  - \( \mu_{\text{signal}} \) is the mean signal intensity in the region of interest.
  - \( \sigma_{\text{noise}} \) is the standard deviation of the signal in the background or noise region.

- **CNR**: \( \text{CNR} = \frac{\mu_{\text{signal}} - \mu_{\text{background}}}{\sigma_{\text{background}}} \)
  - \( \mu_{\text{signal}} \) is the mean intensity of the region of interest.
  - \( \mu_{\text{background}} \) is the mean intensity of the background.
  - \( \sigma_{\text{background}} \) is the standard deviation of the background.

#### Example Calculation in Python:

```python
# Define the background region (e.g., outside the mask)
background_mask = ~mask

# Calculate SNR for the masked region
signal_region = image_data[mask]
noise_region = image_data[background_mask]

mean_signal = np.mean(signal_region)
std_noise = np.std(noise_region)

SNR = mean_signal / std_noise
print(f"SNR: {SNR}")

# Calculate CNR (assuming background region is well-defined)
mean_background = np.mean(noise_region)
std_background = np.std(noise_region)

CNR = (mean_signal - mean_background) / std_background
print(f"CNR: {CNR}")
```

### 6. **Summary of Steps**:
1. Convert your **PKL file** to **NIfTI format**.
2. Perform **image registration** to align your **3D image** with the **template atlas**.
3. Use the **probability maps** to create a **mask** of the region of interest.
4. Apply the mask to the **registered image** to isolate the region of interest.
5. Calculate **SNR** and **CNR** using the masked regions and background regions.

### Additional Notes:
- **Thresholding the Probability Map**: You can adjust the threshold value based on the specificity of the regions you want to mask.
- **Post-processing**: You may want to smooth the images or apply other filters depending on your analysis.
